            <h2>How do we disclose your information?</h2>
            <ul class="ul_modif">
                Except as noted in this Policy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your
                personally identifiable information without your consent. Additionally, Tinvio does not use any
                personally identifiable information for advertisements unrelated to the marketing and promotion of the
                Services.
                <br><br>
                We may share your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device
                identifiers, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that
                Tinvio is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information
                to help provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates'
                own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).
                <br><br>
                We also may share your information with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to
                you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is
                reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms. For example, these
                providers may help us administer our Website and Applications, manage and administer Services, or
                process credit card payments. Where required by law, these companies agree to only use such information
                for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us unless you expressly permit them to use your
                information for other purposes.
                <br><br>
                We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymised data with other parties. We may
                also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you
                and share that aggregated information.
                <br><br>
                We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable
                information only if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary
                to comply with applicable laws and regulations in or outside Singapore, international law or respond to
                a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an
                individual's physical safety may be at risk or threatened.
            </ul>
            <!-- ------------ -->
            <h2>What Happens in the Event of a Change of Control?</h2>
            <p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Tinvio or our assets to another organization (e.g.,
                in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your
                information collected through the Services may be among the items sold or transferred. The buyer or
                transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <!-- ------------ -->
            <h2>How We Store Your Information?</h2>
            <p>The Services are hosted in Singapore. If you are visiting from the United States, European Union or other
                regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from Singapore law, please note that
                you are transferring your personal data to Singapore which does not have the same data protection laws
                as the United States or EU or other regions and by providing your personal data you consent to: THE USE
                OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE USES IDENTIFIED ABOVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY; AND THE
                TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO SINGAPORE AS INDICATED ABOVE.
                We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service
                secure. However, Tinvio cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Tinvio or
                guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
            <!-- ------------ -->
            <h2>Third party links:</h2>
            <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our
                Service, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a
                link to go from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those
                third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service,
                including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and
                policies.</p>
            <!-- ------------ -->
            <h2>Access to and Modification of your Personal Information:</h2>
            <p>Upon request, Tinvio will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a
                third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please e-mail us at
                privacy@tinvio.com.<br>
                If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update,
                delete/remove, or ask to have it removed from a public forum or testimonial by making the change within
                your account settings or by contacting us via one of the methods listed in this Policy. Please note that
                copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may continue to reside in our systems
                for a period of time. Also, you may not be able to remove your personal information from archived web
                pages that we no longer maintain. In the event we are unable to complete your access request, we will
                let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
                repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardise the privacy of others, are extremely
                impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.<br>
                If your information has been shared with a third party, as described above, or collected on behalf of a
                third party, then that third party has received their own copy of your data. If you have been contacted
                by one of these third parties and wish to correct or request they delete your information, please
                contact them directly.<br>
                If you wish to not have your personal information shared with third parties for the creation and display
                of targeted advertisements, you will need to close your account. This action may be possible through the
                settings within your account or by contacting us at privacy@tinvio.com. We do not recommend that you do
                this unless you plan to no longer use the Services and will have no need to receive further
                communications from us or through our system. Even after you opt-out of all communications, we will
                retain your information in accordance with this Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact
                you. However, third parties who have received your information in accordance with this Policy may still
                use that information to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use
                our system to do so.<br>
                If you would like to delete your account with us, you may do so by emailing us at privacy@tinvio.com and
                specifying which account(s) to delete.</p>
            <!-- ------------ -->
            <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy:</h2>
            <p>Tinvio may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We
                may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the
                circumstances. Your continued use of Tinvio or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy
                will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
                <br>This policy was last modified in Singapore on July 16, 2019.

                to pay to us such proportion of the PSP Fees as we deem fit and reasonable in our sole discretion for
                your use of such third party payment services per transaction order. In the event that you will be
                charged for any part of the PSP Fees, we will notify you of such additional charges before your next
                billing cycle.
                <br><br>
                If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide
                us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent
                bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right to change
                products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with
                us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per user, per outlet, per
                merchant, or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer
                account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the
                event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail
                and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
